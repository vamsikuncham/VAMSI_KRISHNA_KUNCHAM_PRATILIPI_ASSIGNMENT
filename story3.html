      <p>
        Once upon a time there lived a hunter in a small village. The hunter
        sets out to catch birds. He lays a net and spreads rice all over it.
        Shortly, a flock of pigeons comes by and start eating the rice and get
        caught in the net.
      </p>
      <p>
        They start to lose hopes. Just then their leader asks them to fly
        together up in the sky. They do as told and carry the net with
        themselves. The hunter runs after them but is not able to catch them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pigeons fly towards their friend mouseâ€™s hole. The mouse on seeing
        this cuts the net into pieces and frees all the pigeon.
