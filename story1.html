      <p>
        One day a rabbit was boasting about how fast he could run. He was
        laughing at the turtle for being so slow. Much to the rabbitâ€™s surprise,
        the turtle challenged him to a race. The rabbit thought this was a good
        joke and accepted the challenge. The fox was to be the umpire of the
        race. As the race began, the rabbit raced way ahead of the turtle, just
        like everyone thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rabbit got to the halfway point and could not see the turtle
        anywhere. He was hot and tired and decided to stop and take a short nap.
        Even if the turtle passed him, he would be able to race to the finish
        line ahead of him. All this time the turtle kept walking step by step by
        step. He never quit no matter how hot or tired he got. He just kept
        going.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the rabbit slept longer than he had thought and woke up. He
        could not see the turtle anywhere! He went at full speed to the finish
        line but found the turtle there waiting for him.
